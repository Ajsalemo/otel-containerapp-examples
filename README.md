# otel-containerapp-examples
Various languages using the OTEL SDK and "codeless" setup that can be deployed to Container Apps
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Each language and subfolder has a `README.md` for general steps on running and deploying these examples.

This can be used with [Collect and read OpenTelemetry data in Azure Container Apps (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/opentelemetry-agents?tabs=arm) - these images are intended to build and deployed to Container Apps for sending telemetry through OpenTelemetry.

Each application can write telemetry to console, or, to an OTLP endpoint through gRPC depending on the environment. See the respective `README.md`'s for more information.
